My name is Jacky. I was born on a warm, sunny day in September in Taipei of September twentyfifth, Taiwan. I now live in Taipei, Taiwan, and I go to school at National Chengchi University. I live with my mom, Kate; my brother, Jake; and my Aunt Molly. When I was born, my bother was fifteen-months-old and hid under the table from me. Jake is a sweet kid and he would do anything for me, but like all brothers and sisters we fight like cats and dogs. Sometimes when no one was around, Jake would come up to me and bite my toes for no reason. I still love him but only because he is my brother.
