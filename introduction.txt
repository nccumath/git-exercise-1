My name is Kyle. I was born on a warm, sunny day in November in Taipei. I now live in Taipei, and I go to school at National Chengchi University. I live with my parent; my sister; and my . Jake is a sweet kid and he would do anything for me, but like all brothers and sisters we fight like cats and dogs. Sometimes when no one was around, Jake would come up to me and bite my toes for no reason. I still love him but only because he is my brother.
